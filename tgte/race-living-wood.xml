    <description>
      <p>Living Wood are sentient plantfolk deliberately created by druidic circles to serve as companions, assistants, and guardians of the natural world. Through ancient rites blending druidic magic with living timber, these beings are grown rather than born—shaped with emotions, cognition, and moral reasoning comparable to humanoids. Living Wood are alive, aware, and capable of choice—crafted to endure where others pass on.</p>
