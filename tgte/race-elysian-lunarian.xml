    <description>
      <p>Lunarians are an extraordinarily rare people believed to be descendants of the Moon itself—or shaped so completely by lunar influence that the distinction no longer matters. Deeply attuned to magic and the night sky, Lunarians perceive arcane forces instinctively, reacting to spells and supernatural phenomena in ways that often defy mortal logic.</p>
      <p>They age slowly, experience time differently, and are known for emotional intensity and fixation. To Lunarians, obsession is not a flaw but a natural consequence of lunar influence—a narrowing of focus that can last decades or centuries.</p>
      <p>Two forms of Lunarians exist: Pure Lunarians, whose bodies fully reflect their lunar heritage, and Lunar-Touched, members of other ancestries altered by the Moon’s influence.</p>

      <h4>TRAITS</h4>
      <span class="feature">Ability Score Increase. </span>Your ability score increases are determined by your Lunarian Origin.<br />
      <span class="feature">Size. </span>You are Medium.<br />
      <span class="feature">Speed. </span>Your walking speed is 35 feet.<br />
      <span class="feature">Age. </span>You mature at a rate similar to humans, but age far more slowly. Pure Lunarians commonly live between 800 and 1,000 years. Lunar-Touched Lunarians live significantly longer than members of their origin ancestry, often reaching twice the expected lifespan.<br />
      <span class="feature">Languages. </span>You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice.<br />
      <span class="feature">Arcane Training. </span>You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. In addition, you gain proficiency in either Perception or Performance (your choice).<br />
      <span class="feature">Lunar Perception. </span>You have blindsight out to 20 feet.<br />
      <span class="feature">Lunar Glow. </span>Once per short rest, as a bonus action, you emit moonlight in a 5-foot radius of bright light, with dim light for an additional 10 feet. This light lasts for 10 minutes or until you dismiss it (no action required).<br />
      <span class="feature">Arcane Sensitivity. </span>Once per long rest, when you are required to make a saving throw against a spell, you can choose to gain advantage on that saving throw. You can use this trait even if you cannot see the source of the spell. You must choose before rolling.<br />
      <span class="feature">Lunar Reactions. </span>When using Lunar Glow, casting spells, or standing beneath moonlight, subtle signs may appear: hair emitting a faint glow, arcane markings becoming visible, eyes reflecting pale lunar light.<br />
      <span class="feature">Lunarian Origin. </span>Choose one: Pure Lunarian or Lunar-Touched.<br />
